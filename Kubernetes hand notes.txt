>>>Kubernetes Architecture:- by Sreeharsha Veerapally

-k8s admin: i want to deploy sample app with 6 containers
-First go to k8 control plane/master server
-First we have to contact with k8 API SERVER
-Pods are running under k8 API server ,pods are nothing but containers
-kubectl->kubernetes command line tool like shell to automate the commands 
-jube API server is very imp ,it acts like gateway(managing) ,without appoval we cant do anything
-whatever the contect which sent to APIserver ,ETCD will store all the data which was comming from api server and it acts like database
-worker nodes are nothing but slaves,k8 control plane is controling the worker nodes
-Kubelet is act like manager for the nodes,kubelet sits in every node,without kubelet  involvement u can't do anything
-kube-scheduler acts like PA to K8 api server,it is giving tasks to kube-scheduler to do things like when api server is gettting anything from 
k8 admin it will ask that check it once is it ok not to kube-scheduler
-kube-scheduler acts like monitor tool only for K8 API server
-kube-scheduler gives response to k8 API SERVER's request
-k8 Admin > k8 API server >k8-ETCD >k8API SERVER >kube-scheduler>response k8-API server > k8-API server giving tasks to KUBELET to do the things
-now kubelet will deploy the containers in pods

-KUBE -CONTROL -MANAGER:
-kube control manager is acts like monitoring the tool,it is a combination of certain services,
--eg:if a master node  failed it will replaces those pods to another master node
-In kube-control manager we have mainly 4 services 1 Node controller,2replication controller,3 End point controller,4 secret-config,
-it is conneting to K8 api server

-KUBE PROXY:
-kube proxy is sitting in each node including master node
-kube proxy main job is handling the traffic
-it is implemanting the network rules like tcp udp http https 
-stoped  in 1hour
